## Overview

1. [Five Characteristics](#chatacteristics)
2. Three deployment models 
3. Three service models


### I. <a name = "characterisitcs"> Five Characteristics</a>
<ol>
    <li> On-demand self service</li>
    <li> Broad network access - tables, computers, etc. can all access</li>
    <li> Resource pooling - resource dynamically assigned based on demand</li>
    <li> Rapid elasticity - scale up or back based on need</li>
    <li> Measured service - paying what you used</li>
</ol>


### II. Three deployment models
<ol>
    <li> Public </li>
    <li> Private </li>
    <li> Hybrid </li>
</ol>

### III. Three service models (from bottom to top)
<ol>
    <li> <strong>IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service </strong>- a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
    <li> PaaS </li>
    <li> SaaS </li>
    <li> Difference among the three: </li>
</ol>

### IV. History and Evolution of Cloud Computing
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Virtual Machines </strong> - mutiple distinct compute environments on the same physical hardware</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Hypervisor</strong> - a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. Assigning each virtual machine a portion of the underlying computing power.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Pay-as-you-go model</strong>- pay only what you needed. Key driver behind cloud computing taking off. Help business to switch from CapEx to OpEx (instead of investing in a hardware, pay the cloud service as operating expense when needed). </li>
</ul>

### V. Key Considerations for Cloud Computing
<ul>
    <li> Key motives for Cloud Computing
        <ol>
            <li>Agility</li>
            <li>Flexibility</li>
            <li>Competitiveness</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Key considerations
        <ol>
            <li> Pay-as-you-go can save large amount of money compared with building a data center.</li>
            <li> SaaS and development platforms-
                Whether paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shore software and subsequently investing in upgrades
            </li>
            <li> SPEED AND PRODUCTIVITY - 1) what does it mean to organization to have a software up and running for days, weeks or months 2) person-hour efficiency increases from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics and analytics
            </li>
            <li> Risk exposure
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
